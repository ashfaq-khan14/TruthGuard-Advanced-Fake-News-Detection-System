# FAKE NEWS DETECTER ALERT

  - ![WhatsApp Image 2024-02-28 at 21 05 18_0a69d5d7](https://github.com/ashfaq-khan14/fake-news-detecter/assets/120010803/6a87f4e1-2c90-48fb-9207-7433db7bed82)

---

## Overview
The Fake News Detector project aims to develop a machine learning model capable of identifying fake news articles from genuine ones. By analyzing various features such as language, source credibility, and content structure, the model can accurately classify news articles as either fake or genuine, helping users distinguish between reliable and unreliable sources of information.

## Dataset
The project utilizes a dataset containing news articles labeled as fake or genuine. The dataset is collected from various sources, including news websites, fact-checking organizations, and social media platforms.

## Features
- *Textual Content*: News articles serve as the main feature for fake news detection.
- *Source Credibility*: Information about the source of the news article, such as domain authority and past reliability.
- *Language Patterns*: Analysis of language patterns, sentiment, and writing style in the articles.
- *Metadata*: Additional metadata such as publication date, author information, and article length.

## Models Used
- *Logistic Regression*: Simple and interpretable baseline model for binary classification tasks.
- *Random Forest*: Ensemble method for improved predictive performance, capable of handling nonlinear relationships in data.
- *Deep Learning Models*: Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or Transformer architectures for capturing semantic relationships in text data.

## Evaluation Metrics
- *Accuracy*: Measures the proportion of correctly classified articles among all articles.
- *Precision*: Measures the proportion of true positive predictions among all positive predictions.
- *Recall*: Measures the proportion of true positive predictions among all actual positive instances.
- *F1 Score*: Harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balance between the two metrics.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   
   git clone https://github.com/ashfaq-khan14/fake-news-detecter.git
   
2. Install dependencies:
   
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   

## Usage
1. Preprocess the dataset (if necessary) and prepare the features and target variable.
2. Split the data into training and testing sets.
3. Train the machine learning models using the training data.
4. Evaluate the models using the testing data and appropriate evaluation metrics.
5. Fine-tune hyperparameters and select the best-performing model for deployment.

## Example Code
python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report

# Load the dataset
data = pd.read_csv('news_articles.csv')

# Split features and target variable
X = data['content']
y = data['label']

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Convert text data into TF-IDF vectors
vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer()
X_train_tfidf = vectorizer.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test_tfidf = vectorizer.transform(X_test)

# Initialize and train the classifier
classifier = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
classifier.fit(X_train_tfidf, y_train)

# Predict on the testing set
y_pred = classifier.predict(X_test_tfidf)

# Evaluate the classifier
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))


## Future Improvements
- *Advanced Feature Engineering*: Explore additional features such as social media engagement, fact-checker ratings, and content metadata.
- *Deep Learning Architectures*: Experiment with advanced deep learning architectures such as Transformers for capturing complex linguistic relationships.
- *Ensemble Methods*: Combine predictions from multiple models using ensemble techniques for better generalization.
- *Real-time Monitoring*: Develop a system for real-time monitoring of news articles to detect fake news as soon as it is published.

## Deployment
- *Web Browser Extension*: Develop a browser extension that warns users when they visit websites known for publishing fake news.
- *API Integration*: Expose model predictions through a RESTful API for seamless integration with news aggregator platforms and social media networks.

## Acknowledgments
- *Data Sources*: Mention the sources from where the dataset was collected.
- *Inspiration*: Acknowledge any existing projects or research papers that inspired this work.
